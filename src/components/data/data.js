    description: "Like its predecessor, the GTC4Lusso is a 3-door shooting-brake with an all-wheel drive drivetrain, and is powered by a front-mid mounted V12 engine.The GTC4Lussos 6,262 cc (382.1 cu in) Ferrari F140 65° V12 engine is rated at 690 PS (507 kW; 681 hp) at 8,000 rpm and 697 N⋅m (514 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,750rpm.[2] The increase in output of the engine is due to the compression ratio raised to 13.5:1.[2] Ferrari claims a top speed of 335 km/h (208 mph), unchanged from the FF,[3] and a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time of 3.4 seconds.[2]The car uses an improved version (called the 4RM Evo) of Ferrari's patented four-wheel drive system introduced on the FF, integrated with four-wheel steering into the system. Collectively, the system is called 4RM-S. The GTC4Lusso was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show",

The increase in performance is provided in a more reactive way thanks to lightening solutions on the rotating masses, such as the F1 derived titanium connecting rods.",
